# Array_Exercises_In_C++
In this repository, common exercises in working with arrays are written in C++ language.

## polynomial_1:
In the polynomial_1 file, a polynomial is implemented with the help of a one-dimensional array. that the elements in the array are the coefficients of the sentences and the indices are the powers of the polynomial sentences.

## polynomial_2:
In this method, a two-dimensional array is used to implement polynomials.

## Multiply_Of_Matrix:
In this program, the information of two matrices is taken from the user, and according to the rules of matrix multiplication, two matrices are multiplied together. At the end, the resulting matrix is displayed in the output.

## Sparse_matrix:
The matrices with a large number of zero elements are called sparse matrices. To optimize, we use the sparse matrix method that you can see in the code.

## Sparse_matrix_transfer:
In this code, the information of a sparse matrix is taken from the user, and then its output is stored in a new two-dimensional array using the sparse method.

## Sum_Of_Sparse_Matrix:
In this program, the information of two sparse matrices is taken from the user and displayed in the output. Then, according to the rules of the addition of two sparse matrices, the sum of the two matrices is stored in a new two-dimensional array.
