# Array_Exercises_In_C++
In this repository, common exercises in working with arrays are written in C++ language.

## polynomial_1:
In the polynomial_1 file, a polynomial is implemented with the help of a one-dimensional array. that the elements in the array are the coefficients of the sentences and the indices are the powers of the polynomial sentences.

## polynomial_2:
In this method, a two-dimensional array is used to implement polynomials.

## Multiply_Of_Matrix:
In this program, the information of two matrices is taken from the user, and according to the rules of matrix multiplication, two matrices are multiplied together. At the end, the resulting matrix is displayed in the output.
